# push_swap

#### 42school project. 
The goal of a project is to implement a sorting algorythm on two stacks.
According to the rules, only four commands can be used: swap, push, rotate and reverse. 

## What did I learn
- Basic algorythms
- Data structures

For a middle list from 5 to 100 elements I developed my own algorithm. For a list which consists of more than 100 elements I implemented a merge sort adapted for stacks. 

## How to build
```
$> make
```

## How to launch
```
$> ./push_swap int1 int2 int3 ... int4
```

### Efficiency
 - Small list - 12 commands
 - Middle list (100 elems) - 540 commands 
 - Big list (500 elems) - 5450 commands
