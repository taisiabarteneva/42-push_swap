# push_swap

Implemetation of a sorting algorythm on two stacks. 
According to the rules, only four commands can be used: swap, push, rotate and reverse. 

For a list which consists of more than 100 elements I implemented a merge sort adapted for stacks. 

Built : 
$> make

Usage :
$> ./push_swap <list of integers>
